## Introduction

In the context of network ecology, the structural importance of a species for an ecosystem is usually assessed via one or more measures of centrality. The approach rests on the idea that species that are involved in more energetic pathways tend to be more important for the stability of a food web. The literature is rich with centrality measures adopted from the most different fields.

Another important facet of the role of a species in an ecosystem is its uniqueness, i.e., the similarity of a species role to the roles of the other species in the ecosystem. Highly unique species are less redundant, and therefore their loss may result in a greater functional diversity loss in the community.

The evidence presented in the ecological literature is not clear: some seems to support a positive correlation between uniqueness and centrality, some other goes against this hypothesis. The conundrum may depend on the effect of network shape, dimension or other ecological variables.

In this vignette we will test the hypothesis that central species in ecological networks are ecologically unique in a publicly available dataset of 14 food webs, ranging from 20 nodes to 128 nodes. 

We consider node degree as a basic, common, centrality measure and we define the ecological uniqueness of a species in a food web as its averaged distance to the other species in the network-trait space determined by the food web.

Not all the interaction in a food web are equal: for example, they represent larger or smaller energetic flows. Thus, food webs can be _weighted_---and the entries of their adjacency matrix correspond to some measure of the energetic flow---or _topological_ (binary)---where links are simply represented as present (1) or absent (0). Although topological webs convey less information, they are much easier to be produced.
We will test whether the ecological uniquenesses we estimate from the weighted and the topological representations of a food web are correlated. A positive answer suggests that we can, at least partially, rely on the common spread topological representation to assess species uniqueness.

We are also moved by an underlying theoretical interest, that is, we want to explore the applicability of Random Dot-Product Graphs modelling of food webs [Dalla Riva and Stouffer, 2016, Oikos](http://gvdr.github.io/science/Rdpg).

Finally, **this is the vignette, not the manuscript**: we left many details to the manuscript itself, and the analytic flow presented here is not complete. We do not limit the analysis to the degree, and we consider other datasets with both unipartite and bipartite webs. However, here we go in the details of the flow from the raw webs to a satistifactory result.

### Implementation: tidy

All the analysis _in this vignette_ are performed in R. We operate in the tidy-verse and, therefore, depend on a set of (quite common) libraries.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(reshape2)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
```

To keep the reading time short, we also use some functions we will source but not present in this vignette. The input/output functions we source from `io.R` are described in the details in another vignette, and they permit us to transform the _Pajek_ raw data to the data we use here. The ancillary functions in `ancillary.R` take charge of some minor operations, such as sourcing whole directories. All the plot functions are collected in `plot_functs.R`: they are basic layering over `ggplot2`.

```{r}
#the location of io.R:
source("../../R/ancillary.R")
source("../../R/io.R")
source("../../R/plot_functs.R")

#the location of the R files of ecolowdgy: 
ecolowdgy.dir <- "../../R/ecolowdgy/"

#where to save the zip archive with the raw weighted webs:
dest.file <- "../../Data/Raw/Weighted_webs.zip"

#either `FALSE` or the folder where to save the Rdata
Save.weighted.igraphs <- FALSE
```

## Data

We analyse a set of 14 weighted food webs from http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/bio/foodweb/foodweb.htm (see the website for more informations). The original data was in the _SCOR_ format (July 2002 by R.E. Ulanowicz), it has been transformed to _Pajek_ by Vladimir Batagelj in 2004. Here we further transform them to _igraph_ objects and get their weighted adjacency matrices.

```{r}
"http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/bio/FoodWeb/Webs_paj.zip" %>%
  download.file(dest.file, mode="wb")
dest.file %>% unzip(list=TRUE) -> webs.list
webs.list
```

Obtained the name of the food webs present in the file, and having already coded a little function to transform _Pajek projects_ into `igraph` objects, we build a nested data frame with a column hosting the food webs' adjacency matrices. We keep them in a wide format as this allows a prompter application of our mathematical tools.

```{r, message=FALSE}
w_adjs_df <- data_frame(name_web = webs.list$Name[-dim(webs.list)[1]])  %>%
  mutate(
    adjacency = map(name_web, ~.x %>%
                            unz(dest.file,.) %>%
                            adjacency_from_paj %>%
                            tbl_df() )
               ) %>%
  mutate(name_web =  name_web %>%
                     str_replace_all("[\\.]?paj[\\/]?",""))
```

And, we store store it, if we want, as an `.Rdata` file for a quick retrieval.

```{r}
if(Save.weighted.igraphs != FALSE){
  save(w_adjs_df, file = Save.weighted.igraphs)
}
```

### What do we have in the dataset?

A quick look at our data frame already allows us to retrieve some information, such as the number of nodes in the ecological networks:

```{r}
w_adjs_df
```

### Weight distribution

We expect, if we have done everything right so far, the distribution of the interaction weights in any of them to look log-normally distributed. We can ocularly check this quickly.

```{r}
w_adjs_df %>%
  filter(name_web %in% "Florida") %>%
  select(-name_web) %>%
  unnest(adjacency) %>%
  as.matrix.data.frame() %>%
  {hist(log(.),breaks = 20)}
```

It looks rather Log-normal (and we leave normality testing for later).

## Methods

For each matrix, we compute each species' abstract traits from the weighted, the log transformed weighted and the topological adjacency matrix (see [Dalla Riva & Stouffer, Oikos (2016)](http://gvdr.github.io/science/Rdpg) for more details).

We will use some of the functions in the `ecolowdgy` package (to appear). The package provides an analytical framwork for studying food webs as represented in a low dimensional geometrical space (somewhat akin to Hutchinson's _hyperdimensional cube_).

_Now is a good moment to check where the package is. I provided it here for ease of use of this vignette, soon it will be possible to download it from its github repository._

```{r}
list.files(ecolowdgy.dir)
sourceDir(ecolowdgy.dir)
```

### Matrix transformations

First of all we increase the data frame with the log transformed and the topological transformed versions of the adjacency matrix. While we do it we collect also some basic descriptive information about the networks, such as their dimension (the number of nodes), the number of ecological interactions they show and their connectance (the ratio between the number of nodes and the square of the number of ecological interactions).

```{r}
w_adjs_df %<>% mutate(
    adjacency_log = map(adjacency, ~.x %>%
                                 as.matrix() %>%
                                 {ifelse(. > 0,log(.),-100)} %>%
                                 tbl_df()),
    
    adjacency_topo = map(adjacency, ~.x %>%
                                 as.matrix() %>%
                                 {ifelse(. > 0,1,0)} %>%
                                 tbl_df()),
    
    dimension = map(adjacency_topo,
      ~.x %>% nrow()) ,
    
    n_link = map(adjacency_topo,
      ~.x %>% sum())
) %>%
  unnest(dimension,n_link) %>%
  mutate(connectance = n_link / (dimension ^ 2))
```

Let's take a look at what we have. We filter one food web, select its adjacency---either the original weighted version, the log transformed on or the topological transformation of it---, unnest it and plot it as a matrix.

```{r}
original <- w_adjs_df %>%
  plot_adjacency("Florida","adjacency","Adjacency")

logged <- w_adjs_df %>%
  plot_adjacency("Florida","adjacency_log","Log-transformed")

topoed <- w_adjs_df %>%
  plot_adjacency("Florida","adjacency_topo","Topological")

grid.arrange(original, logged, topoed, ncol = 3)
```

Not the best represantation, we could have done something better with `ggplot` but it's enough to understand the transformation are doing what we want: indeed, the three raster images looks similar.

### Centrality measures: degree

We are all set to collect some classic centrality measures about the nodes. A basic one is the number of portion of interactions each node is involved in, either as a source of the interaction or as a sink. This measure can be measured from the topological adjacency---and the measurament value will be the count the number of interactions---or in one of the two weighted adjacency---in which case the measurement value will be weighted by the weighted of the interactions.

```{r}
w_adjs_df %<>% mutate(
  degree_in = map(adjacency,
                         ~.x %>% colSums()),
  degree_out = map(adjacency,
                          ~.x %>% rowSums()),
  degree_in_log = map(adjacency_log,
                         ~.x %>% colSums()),
  degree_out_log = map(adjacency_log,
                          ~.x %>% rowSums()),
  degree_in_topo = map(adjacency_topo,
                         ~.x %>% colSums()),
  degree_out_topo = map(adjacency_topo,
                          ~.x %>% rowSums())
)
```

### Network Traits

In the cited Oikos paper we introduce the concept of abstract functional traits for species in food webs. They describe the role of a species in a food web as a predator (consumer) and as a prey (resource) determining its interaction probability with the other species.

To keep the code readable, we better use a couple of ancillary functions that we will use in the `mutate`+`map` flow.

```{r}
traits_nest <- function(x,Rank,traits_mode) {
data.frame(node_name = colnames(x),
           rank = Rank,
           mode = traits_mode,
           trait = traits(x, Rank,
                          Partition = "uni",
                          Mode = traits_mode)
           )
}

traits_in_out <- function(x,Rank){
  bind_rows(
    traits_nest(x,Rank,"inward"),
    traits_nest(x,Rank,"outward")
  )
}
```

And compute them.

```{r}
Rank <- 4
w_adjs_df %<>% mutate(
    traits = map(adjacency,
                        ~.x %>% traits_in_out(Rank)
                        ),
    
    traits_log = map(adjacency_log,
                        ~.x %>% traits_in_out(Rank)
                        ),
    
    traits_topo = map(adjacency_topo,
                        ~.x %>% traits_in_out(Rank)
                        )
    )
```

What have we obtained so far:
```{r}
w_adjs_df
```

### A quick sanity test

Let's do a sanity test and see if anything of what we produced looks familiar. Let's have a look at the first two coordinates of the inward functional traits as estimated from the Everglade's food-web topology:

```{r}
w_adjs_df %>%
  plot_traits("Florida","traits_topo","inward")
```

### Centrality: Functional uniqueness

Finally, let's compute the functional uniqueness of the species. We define it as the average distance from one species to the rest of the community, as computed in one of the original, log-transformed or topological functional-trait space. Again, for sake of clearity, let's use an ancillary function and the `mutate`+`map` flow.

```{r}
get_trait_matrix <- function(traits_df,Mode){

  temp_data <- traits_df %>%
    filter(mode %in% Mode) %>%
    select(-rank,-mode)

  temp_matrix <- temp_data %>% 
    select(-node_name) %>%
    as.matrix()

  row.names(temp_matrix) <- temp_data$node_name

  return(temp_matrix)
}

get_mean_dist <- function(trait_mat){
  dist(trait_mat, upper = TRUE) %>%
  as.matrix() %>% rowMeans() %>%
  {tibble(node_name = names(.),
         MeanDist = .)} %>% return()
}

get_uniqueness_in_out <- function(traits_df){
  bind_rows(
    traits_df %>%
    get_trait_matrix("inward") %>%
    get_mean_dist %>%
    cbind(Mode = "inward",.)
    ,
    traits_df %>%
    get_trait_matrix("outward") %>%
    get_mean_dist %>%
    cbind(Mode = "outward",.)
  ) %>% return()
}
```

Now we are ready to increase the data frame.

```{r}
w_adjs_df %<>% mutate(
    Uniqueness = map(traits,
                        ~.x %>% get_uniqueness_in_out()
                        ),
    
    Uniqueness_log = map(traits_log,
                        ~.x %>% get_uniqueness_in_out()
                        ),
    
    Uniqueness_topo = map(traits_topo,
                        ~.x %>% get_uniqueness_in_out()
                        )
    )
```

### Exposing the centralities

Now we have all the necessary data about the nodes in the ecological networks to explore their distribution in the network and, as we do in the manuscript, their correlation with other ecological (network) indicators---such as other measures of node centrality. We use a two small functions to expose the desidered uniqueness values from our nested data frame (in `io.R`).

The ecological uniqueness in the Florida food web:

```{r}
w_adjs_df %>%
  expose_uniqueness("Florida","Uniqueness_topo","inward")
```

And the topological degree (the number of interaction) in the same web:

```{r}
w_adjs_df %>%
  expose_degree("Florida","degree_in_topo")
```

## Results

### Is the topological approximation sensible?

And we give a look at a scatter plot of the uniqueness values estimated from the topological and the log-transformed adjacency matrix: how much information do we loose when we rank species just from their topological networks (without any information about the link weights)?

```{r}
w_adjs_df %>%
  plot_uniqs("Florida",c("Uniqueness_topo","Uniqueness_log"),"inward")
```

In the rather large _Florida_ food web---128 nodes---the two measures, uniqueness and centrality, look strongly correlated.

```{r}
w_adjs_df %>%
  plot_uniqs("Rhode",c("Uniqueness_topo","Uniqueness_log"),"inward")
```

The correlation between topological uniqueness and log-transformed uniquess may be less significant for the much smaller _Rhode_ food web (20 nodes). May it depend on the dimension of the food web? The RDPG embedding we use to compute the traits is granted to be optimal asymptotically, so it may be not efficient for small webs. Let's gather the information from the full dataset and see if the correlation gets stronger (in terms of significance and variance explained) with larger webs.

```{r}
uniqueness_correlation <- function(webs_df,Web_name,Tran_x_y,Mode_uniqueness){
  expose_uniqueness(webs_df,Web_name,Tran_x_y[1],Mode_uniqueness) %>%
  left_join(
      expose_uniqueness(webs_df,Web_name,Tran_x_y[2],Mode_uniqueness),
      by = c("node_name")
    ) %>%
  lm(MeanDist.x ~ MeanDist.y,data = .) %>%
  broom::glance() %>%
    return()
}
```

```{r}
X_Y <- c("Uniqueness_topo","Uniqueness_log")
Mode_ars <- "outward"
w_adjs_df %<>%
  mutate(
    adj_r_squared_topo_log_outward = map(
      name_web,
      ~.x %>% uniqueness_correlation(w_adjs_df,.,X_Y,Mode_ars)
  )
)
```

So, does the quality of the approximation depends on the dimension of the food web?

```{r}
adjs_r <- w_adjs_df %>%
  unnest(adj_r_squared_topo_log_outward) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dimension,adj.r.squared)) +
  geom_point()  +
  xlab("dimension") + ylab("Adjusted R squared") +
  theme_minimal()

pval <- w_adjs_df %>%
  unnest(adj_r_squared_topo_log_outward) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dimension,p.value)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05) +
  geom_point()  +
  xlab("dimension") + ylab("p value") +
  theme_minimal()

grid.arrange(adjs_r, pval, top = "Topological vs. Log")
```

Not really, as far as we can tell. The models explain most of the variation and they are consistently significant, no matter the dimension of the web. Maybe, afterall, we can trust the ranking we gather from the topological representations of the ecological networks.

### Are degree centrality and uniqueness correlated?

There is something more to our interest. If we look at the _Florida_ food web, and in particular at the distribution of its node degrees and uniqueness, they appear correlated: central nodes are more unique.

```{r}
out_p <- w_adjs_df %>%
  plot_deg_uniq("Florida",c("Uniqueness_topo","degree_out_topo"),"outward")

in_p <- w_adjs_df %>%
  plot_deg_uniq("Florida",c("Uniqueness_topo","degree_in_topo"),"inward")

grid.arrange(out_p, in_p, ncol = 2)
```

This, and a lot of ecological literature, motivates us to explore the hypothesis that uniqueness and centrality are correlated. In fact, the literature points in opposing direction, with suggestive evidence of both negative and positive (as well as null) correlation. Thus, the result will be particularly interesting.

```{r}
centrality_correlation <- function(webs_df,Web_name,Tran_x_y,Mode_uniqueness){
  deg_name <- Tran_x_y[2] %>% as.character()
  y <- expose_uniqueness(webs_df,Web_name,Tran_x_y[1],Mode_uniqueness) %>%
    select(-node_name) %>% unlist() %>% as.numeric()
  x <- expose_degree(webs_df,Web_name,deg_name) %>%
    select(-node_name) %>% unlist() %>% as.numeric()
  lm(y ~ x) %>%
  broom::glance() %>%
   return()
}

w_adjs_df %<>%
  mutate(
    uniqueness_degree_topo_out = map(
      name_web,
      ~.x %>% centrality_correlation(w_adjs_df,.,
                                     c("Uniqueness_topo","degree_out_topo"),
                                     "outward"))
      ,
      uniqueness_degree_topo_in = map(
      name_web,
      ~.x %>% centrality_correlation(w_adjs_df,.,
                                     c("Uniqueness_topo","degree_in_topo"),
                                     "inward"))
)
```

Let us see the result of our computations. First by looking at the data frames:

```{r}
w_adjs_df %>%
  select(uniqueness_degree_topo_in) %>%
  unnest()

w_adjs_df %>%
  select(uniqueness_degree_topo_out) %>%
  unnest()
```

And then by looking at them graphically.

```{r}
w_adjs_df %>%
  plot_summary_stat(c("uniqueness_degree_topo_in","uniqueness_degree_topo_out"),
                    "adj.r.squared")
```

Finally, we can conclude that in our dataset the degree centrality of nodes in an ecological network a predictor of their ecological uniqueness.

## Conclusions

```{r}
w_adjs_df %>%
 plot_deg_uniq_all(c("Uniqueness_topo","degree_out_topo"),"outward")
```

We showed that, at least in the dataset we considered, species playing a highly distinctive role in their food web tend to be more important (central) for that food web. There remains to be explained the driver of the correlation coefficient.
