## Getting the good stuff out the messy format

In the zoo of format encoding food webs, _pajek_ is not my cup of tea. For one thing, it does not really cope well with **igraph**. And I like **igraph**. Alas!, a lot of old data is still available only as a Pajek project, so we are going to extract an `igraph` object from a Pajek project file (usually they are recognisable for the `.paj` suffix).

We will need some of the classic R libraries and three libraries, `network` to handle Pajek files, `igraph` for producing the desired data structures and `intergraph` to translate between Pajek and igraph.

```{r}
required_packages <- c("network",
                       "igraph",
                       "intergraph",
                       "magrittr",
                       "dplyr",
                       "reshape2",
                       "purrr")

source("../../R/ancillary.R") #provides try_and_install
try_and_install(required_packages)

library(magrittr)
```

We are using an interesting set of weighted Food Web, put together by (Vladimir Batagelj)[http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/bio/foodweb/foodweb.htm] in 2004. To explain the translation, we already manually downloaded and unzipped the _Food webs_ (`Webs_paj.zip`) file to a local folder (`[Project]/Data/Elaborated/paj/`).

Read in pajek networks with `network` and translate them to `igraph` objects with `intergraph`:

```{r}
Cheaspeake_File <- '../../Data/Elaborated/paj/Chesapeake.paj'
Graph_test <- Cheaspeake_File %>% network::read.paj()
Graph_test %>% summary()
Graph_test$networks[[1]] %>% summary()
Net_test <- Graph_test$networks[[1]]
iGraph_test <- Net_test %>% intergraph::asIgraph()
```

Have we done it? Let's get a look to the graph:

```{r}
iGraph_test %T>%
  summary %>%
  plot
```

Where are the edge weights?

```{r}
iGraph_test %>% igraph::list.edge.attributes()
iGraph_test %>% igraph::list.vertex.attributes()
```

Well, there seems to be something, but not really clear what.
Let's take a better look.

```{r}
igraph::V(iGraph_test)$vertex.names %>% head
igraph::V(iGraph_test)$na %>% summary
igraph::E(iGraph_test)$na %>% summary
igraph::E(iGraph_test)$chesapeake %>% summary
```

So, the interaction weights seems to be in `chesapeake`---the variable we are interested in changes name for each food web!---the `na` are all `FALSE` logicals---we can safely ignore them---and `vertex.names` are the names of the nodes in the food web. Let's remove the useless stuff and clear up things.

```{r}
igraph::V(iGraph_test)$name <- igraph::V(iGraph_test)$vertex.names
weight_name <- igraph::get.edge.attribute(iGraph_test)[1] %>% names
weights <- igraph::get.edge.attribute(iGraph_test,weight_name) %>% as.vector
iGraph_test %<>% igraph::set_edge_attr("weight", value = weights)
iGraph_test %<>% igraph::remove.edge.attribute("na") %>%
  igraph::remove.edge.attribute(weight_name) %>%
  igraph::remove.vertex.attribute("na") %>%
  igraph::remove.vertex.attribute("vertex.names")
```

We start seeing something:

```{r}
iGraph_test %>% igraph::plot.igraph(
                     edge.width=log(igraph::E(iGraph_test)$weight)/3,
                     edge.curved=TRUE
                     )
```

Well, the plot is horrible but everything is there. Now let's get the weighted adjacency back and let's forget pajek!

```{r}
Adjacency_test <- iGraph_test %>%
  igraph::get.adjacency(attr = "weight",
                sparse = F)
```

Quick sanity test: do we have the same number of edges and vertices?

```{r}
dim(Adjacency_test)[1] == igraph::vcount(iGraph_test)
sum(Adjacency_test > 0) == igraph::ecount(iGraph_test)
```

Cool, now we can do science.

Let's wrap everything up in a function:

```{r}
adjacency_from_paj <- function(name,base){
  
  Net_paj <- network::read.paj(paste0(base,name))
  Net_net <- Net_paj$networks[[1]]
  Web <- intergraph::asIgraph(Net_net)
  
  igraph::V(Web)$name <- igraph::V(Web)$vertex.names
  weight_name <- names(igraph::get.edge.attribute(Web)[1])
  weights <- as.vector(igraph::get.edge.attribute(Web,weight_name))
  Web <- igraph::set_edge_attr(Web,"weight", value = weights)
  Web <- igraph::remove.edge.attribute(Web,"na")
  Web <- igraph::remove.edge.attribute(Web,weight_name)
  Web <- igraph::remove.vertex.attribute(Web,"na")
  Web <- igraph::remove.vertex.attribute(Web,"vertex.names")
  
  Adjacency_test <- igraph::get.adjacency(Web,attr = "weight",sparse = F)
  
  return(Adjacency_test)
}
```

and let's test it:

```{r}
Michigan_ad <- adjacency_from_paj("Michigan.paj","../../Data/Elaborated/paj/")
sum(Michigan_ad > 0)
max(Michigan_ad, na.rm = T)
```

We can, for example, give a look at the distribution of the weights in the Michigan Food Web:

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(log(Michigan_ad),
     breaks = 10,
     xlab = "Log-weight of the interaction")
image(log(Michigan_ad), 
      asp = 1,
      xlim = c(0,1),
      ylim = c(0,1))
```

As expected from theory, they are (roughly) log-normal, and there may be some significant nestedness?

A slightly improved version of `adjacency_from_paj()` is available from `io.R` : it works exactly as the one I showcased here but performs a bunch of additional pre-processing tests as the dataset we intend to use is even more messy than what we thought. Isn't that always the case?
